# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains code and resources for building a handwritten digit recognition system using deep learning. Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision and serves as a great introduction to deep learning techniques.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.x installed on your system

TensorFlow and Keras libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digit-recognition.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd digit-recognition
Run the training script:

Copy code
python train_model.py
This script will train a deep neural network on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

Once training is complete, you can use the trained model to predict digits from new images. Modify and use the predict_digit.py script:

arduino
Copy code
python predict_digit.py --image input/image.png
Replace input/image.png with the path to your own handwritten digit image.

Customization
You can customize the architecture of the neural network, hyperparameters, and training settings by modifying the train_model.py script. Experiment with different configurations to achieve better recognition accuracy.
